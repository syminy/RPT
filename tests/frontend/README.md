This directory contains a small Node/jsdom test to exercise `init-action-delegates.js`.

How to run:

1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed (Node 16+ recommended).
2. From the repository root, install dev deps:

   npm install

3. Run the test:

   npm run test-delegation

The script will print `Delegation test result: PASS` on success and non-zero exit on failure.
